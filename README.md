# Luna-Diary
Diary application done in SwiftUI.

## Background

This is an app created for myself and a friend in order to better archive our ideas and thoughts in a fashion we desired for the devices we currently owned, that of iOS devices primarily. 
Additionally, I desired to acquire some experience prior to development of the Rose Cottage Visiting Volunteers Application as this was my first foray into SwiftUI.
I eventually hope to connect this app to a database and provide means of cloud saving of entries especially after a new data structure can be used to further optimize searches and storage.

## Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are needed beyond Xcode in order to run a simulator such that it can be executed. Note that this was initially designed for iPhone 14 devices.

## Setup

Once the IDE (Xcode) is set up, it can be run on the simulated device shortly after a build. However, for testing on a phone, additional steps will have to be taken involving setting the phone into developer mode and subsequently 'trusting' the developer. Afterwards, you can execute it on the phone for testing purposes.

## How to Use

When initalized, you will see a screen with a tab bar at the bottom in which they can all be clicked to navigate to that page for different features. Fundamentally, most of the tabs have the means of adding, deleting, reading or updating entries.
From left to right, the screens are as follows:

**Today** - Displays all the entries of today and touching the entries opens up another screen that allows for editing or deleting of the entry. Finally, the ability to add an entry is on this screen as well.

**Entries** - Displays a calendar which, depending on the date selected, will display any entries on that day such that you can peruse entries on a particular day. Also there is a button to view every single entry.

**On This Day** - Displays all the entries that occured on this day on previous years. This is for a 'memories' aspect of the entries.

**Search** - On this screen, there is a search bar on top which can take text and search all titles and descriptions for if the string is involved in the entry in some capacity.

**Settings** - Displays a list of options which takes the user to subviews for modifying the app itself or clearing data.

Lastly, when creating or updating a diary entry, you can touch the title or description to modify the text shown.
